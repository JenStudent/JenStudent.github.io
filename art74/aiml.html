<p style="color:red;">This was supposed to represented Chowder from the cartoon series. This was before the the model, showing the colors that I pick for this. This was Spade Coco. <p>

<p style="color:red;">This is after running the model, representing the pictures from the colors that I use for the above images. As you can see, I try to make a kitchen and the characters, which didn't came out perfect. <p>

<p style="color:red;">When it comes to the combination of images, I went with a simple concept of merging a variety of Dragon images with a set of elements such as fire, water, and nature. What I was trying to accomplished by making this was to test out something mythical with something real (nonexistence vs. existence). I thought putting the two together would result in something that is quite unworldly, like giving it a sense of a fantasy-like theme with a side of realism as well. This particular creation came to mind from my birthday, where I was born in the year of a Dragon. I also have some fondness with Dragons overall,  being inspired by them when it comes to this project as well as choosing the pictures for this combination. For the elements, I was slightly influenced by 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' and wanted to replicate that same effect from the show to my images. I think the results is a success, though the size of the last image doesn't aligned with the others, making it feel a bit disproportional (though that could be me being a perfectionist).  But other than that, I think it looks good.

P.S. I got lazy to change the order of the original images, so I just wrote which one was the main (1st image) and which one was not (2nd image). <p>
