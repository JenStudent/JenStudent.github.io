<p style="color:red;">The tools to which I'd used for this masterpiece was entirely out of images, more specifically food of different kind. Some images might not be transparent as I wanted for some of them to have a light grey background to make the image popped out a bit more but not too much so you can't see the food. The reason that I have went for this simple concept have to do with the fact that the majority of us like food, and as humans, we sometimes like to experience the variety of food that are prepared for us. Since we live in a diverse community, I wanted to provided some food that some people might or might not have taste and to experience that new sensation (through creating stuff with a click of a button, I mean). And because of those reasons, I have decided to make this, not because I like food, but I like to experience food that I never seen and eaten, as food not only substance us, but are usually delicious! 

For the screenshot, I have decided to just place the food individually instead of spreading it all over the place with my mouse because I really want you to get the feel of the food, as well as to see it. I also made it simple and more on the neutral aspect of colors as I just want you to look only at the food and nothing else. Not like I am trying to make you hungry or anything like that. I think it came out really nice, but of course you can test it out yourself and see what you create out of it.  <p>
