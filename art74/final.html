<h1>This is my story that I made with Twine. </h1>
<img src="https://jenstudent.github.io/images/Screenshot%20(38).png" class="rounded img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Heart">
<p style="color:red;">The story is a point-and-click adventure game, with a side of a novel game. It's more on a horror genre, with a bit of thriller and mystery to the tale (humor might be included). It's about a young boy (Nobody) that was woken up with no memories of who he was, finding himself in a apocalypse world with no human lifeforms, besides mutated creatures that either want to eat or kill him (with the acceptation of some being friendly). Followed him on his journey of bringing light to this lifeless world, as well as discovering where he comes from. Be caution on this survival story, as life and death for Nobody is on your hands (not PG). There will be different endings for the story, too. <p>
<p style="color:red;"> When it comes to the project, I will be employing this website that was provided for me by the teacher, http://twinery.org/, in order to structure the storyline more formally. I may also incorporated Net Art and Game Interaction into my work as well, as to possibly help with the interactive side of the tale. Other techniques may be utilized later on in my project, such as Glitch Art or Photoshop, if needed to. These are some of the techniques that are used for the class' assignments.
P.s. this is just chapter one of the story. <p>
