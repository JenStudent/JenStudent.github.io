<p style="color:red;">The game/interaction that I have made was inspired by the actual game, 'Minecraft', which is a block world that revolved around adventures, crafting, and building stuff for the fun of them all. Why I decided to make this have to do with the fact that this game is well-loved, with millions of people downloading the game and playing together. In a way, it brings people closer as friends, or family, depending who you are playing with. I felt that by making this, it would make the players feel happy knowing the inspiration came from 'Minecraft'.

When it comes to the game, it's supposed to be first-person shooting game but with a mouse. At first, I wanted to make the mouse an arrow like from the game but I realized that the mouse already looks like the tip of the arrow, so I decided not to. In the game, there are five monsters that you usually encounter in the game at night: zombie, enderman, creeper, spider, and skeleton. When you hit a certain score, you will unlocked a monster who point is higher than the first. I also included peaceful mobs such as a villager and a llama to make it a bit harder, as 'shooting' them will lower your score. One of them will leave a huge dent in your score if you hit them, so beware of that. If you hit 100, you win. Some of them might also disappeared from the screen and to get them back, you have to move your mouse everywhere until you hit them. Other than that, have fun. <p>
