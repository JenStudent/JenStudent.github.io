<p> These are all the main characters from Undertale, pretty much the three options you can pick. This was made with Audacity, I believe. <p>

<img src="https://jennystudent.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/6/7/136710700/download-2_orig.jpg" class="rounded-circle img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="pacifist">

<p> These are all characters you will encountered in the game, and what you want to do to them is up to you. This was made with text edit. <p>

<p> This is supposed to be the genocide route, but with the Audacity it became unrecognizable. <p>

<p> This is how I feel about school, and this was made with text edit. <p>

<p> A empty bottle, like me. This was made with text edit as well. <p>

<p>The same bottle, but multipled. This one was made with Audacity. </p>
