<h1>These are my glitches. Some of which follow a particular theme like Undertale, or others associated with something that I am dealing with mentally and physically, like school. </h1>

<p style="color:red;">You might be wondering why did I glitched these images? Well, for my love of experimenting with certain techniques, as well for the game, 'Undertale', I really try to capture that feeling that this game produced for me. While it might be a bit of a trial and error, I do feel that the outcome of these images really do portrayed the game very well. Though I do find the first image to be a bit off when it comes to my feeling toward the game. I do prefer it more green in that particular one. These were created by using Audacity and Notepad++. <p>

<p style="color:red;">This is how I feel about school, and this was made with text edit. <p>

<p style="color:red;">A empty bottle, like me. This was made with text edit as well. <p>
