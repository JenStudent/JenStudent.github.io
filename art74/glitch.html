<h1>These are my glitches that I made with Audacity and Text Edit. </h1>

<p style="color:red;">You might be wondering why did I glitched these images? Well, for my love of experimenting with certain techniques, as well for the game, 'Undertale', I really try to capture that feeling that this game produced for me. While it might be a bit of a trial and error, I do feel that the outcome of these images really do portrayed the game very well. Though I do find the second image to be a bit off when it comes to my feeling toward the game. I do prefer it more green in that particular one. These were created by using Audacity and Text Edit, with the first and third ones from Audacity while the second was Text Edit. <p>

<p style="color:red;">These particular images are for practice. As you can see, my first attempt was a image of a student looking to be struggling in claas of some kind or not paying attention to the lecture. I used Text Edit to create that, as well as the second image which is a bottle that looks to be cut in half. It's supposed to represent me feeling helpless in school, I guess. The last image is the same as the second, however I use Audacity which made it looks like there's more bottle than there really is. It was a interesting take on something so simple and glitching it out with these techiques.  </p>
