<h1>These are my sculptures that I made in Minecraft.</h1>

<p style="color:red;">At first, I was trying to build a red envelope to represent me celebrating Chinese New Year. However, I come to realize that it was not easy to build, and Chinse words and pictures overwhelmed me too much. So I decided to do something easier, and looking at the color red I instantly got an idea of a heart from Undertale. It took a long time to build, and defend against the creatures at night. I choose this particular one because Undertale has been well-known throughout the globe, with many fans backing them up. Not only that, the reason for building a heart is that in the game, love and mercy is the main thing, with the other being genocide. Because of this, I feel the love can be felt from the people that adored this game, including me, and that's why I built this. <p>

<p style="color:red;">So this was the house that I created in survival mode. It's not the best, but I was able to survive through the night so I guess that's an accomplishment for me. I wasn't really planning it to looks nice, but I felt that the glasses of the house, as well as the location of this which was a cave, made it works honestly. For someone that doesn't play a lot of minecraft, it was fun to play it again especially for a class' assignment. Either way, I think the house came out fine (though I did survive more than one nights). <p>
