<h1>These are sculptures that I have created in Minecraft; in surivival mode.</h1>

<p style="color:red;">At first, I was trying to build a red envelope to represent me celebrating Chinese New Year. However, I come to realize that it was not easy to build, and Chinse words and pictures overwhelmed me too much. So I decided to do something easier, and looking at the color red I instantly got an idea of a heart from Undertale. It took a long time to build, and defend against the creatures at night. I choose this particular one because Undertale has been well-known throughout the globe, with many fans backing them up. Not only that, the reason for building a heart is that in the game, love and mercy is the main thing, with the other being genocide. Because of this, I feel the love can be felt from the people that adored this game, including me, and that's why I built this. <p>

<p style="color:red;">This was a house I made while in surivial mode. It's not in the best condition, but I find the imperfect what make it stand out. While I wasn't trying to make art out of it, it became one. <p>
