<h1>I made stories out of them, and let me tell you, it ain't the best.</h1>

<p style="color:red;"> As I was growing up, I was always a troublesome child. By that, what I mean is that there was two ways that you can handle past mistakes; either you let go of your past and move on, or let it affect your life negatively. I was the latter. But as time goes on, with the help of my family (kind of) and my friend(s), I was slowly able to overcome the obstacles that have been following me throughout my life and get better. And thus, I made this short but hopefully interesting story that kind of represent my struggles as I was getting older and possibly shows that you are not the only one that has this problem. 

For the format of this story, I decided to go for only black and white because that's personally how I see the world at the time. It was not the best, I will tell you that. I feel that I could have made this better, but due to the limited amount of time I had to make this story, I am unable to fully established the story fully. But nonetheless, I wanted to be something impactful. Something that you will always remember and used to overcome what problem you having in your life.  There is two routes that you can take, and whatever it's bad or good, it's up to you. I do hope that you like the story. <p>
