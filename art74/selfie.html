<h1>These are some of the works that I have made with codes.</h1>

<p style="color:red;">So this is a portrait of me, which was created by using P5.js. It supposed to be me during the winter time, with the clothes and all that, as well as looking sick. <p>

<p style="color:red;">This was the first draft of my portrait, which was supposed to be a bit abstract. It was a bit everywhere, I will tell you. But nonetheless, it was fun. <p>

<img src="https://jennystudent.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/6/7/136710700/screenshot-11_orig.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="food">
<p style="color:red;">The tools to which I'd used for this masterpiece was entirely out of images, more specifically food of different kind. Some images might not be transparent as I wanted for some of them to have a light grey background to make the image popped out a bit more but not too much so you can't see the food. The reason that I have went for this simple concept have to do with the fact that the majority of us like food, and as humans, we sometimes like to experience the variety of food that are prepared for us. Since we live in a diverse community, I wanted to provided some food that some people might or might not have taste and to experience that new sensation (through creating stuff with a click of a button, I mean). And because of those reasons, I have decided to make this, not because I like food, but I like to experience food that I never seen and eaten, as food not only substance us, but are usually delicious! 

For the screenshot, I have decided to just place the food individually instead of spreading it all over the place with my mouse because I really want you to get the feel of the food, as well as to see it. I also made it simple and more on the neutral aspect of colors as I just want you to look only at the food and nothing else. Not like I am trying to make you hungry or anything like that. I think it came out really nice, but of course you can test it out yourself and see what you create out of it.  <p>

<p style="color:red;">The game/interaction that I have made was inspired by the actual game, 'Minecraft', which is a block world that revolved around adventures, crafting, and building stuff for the fun of them all. Why I decided to make this have to do with the fact that this game is well-loved, with millions of people downloading the game and playing together. In a way, it brings people closer as friends, or family, depending who you are playing with. I felt that by making this, it would make the players feel happy knowing the inspiration came from 'Minecraft'.

When it comes to the game, it's supposed to be first-person shooting game but with a mouse. At first, I wanted to make the mouse an arrow like from the game but I realized that the mouse already looks like the tip of the arrow, so I decided not to. In the game, there are five monsters that you usually encounter in the game at night: zombie, enderman, creeper, spider, and skeleton. When you hit a certain score, you will unlocked a monster who point is higher than the first. I also included peaceful mobs such as a villager and a llama to make it a bit harder, as 'shooting' them will lower your score. One of them will leave a huge dent in your score if you hit them, so beware of that. If you hit 100, you win. Some of them might also disappeared from the screen and to get them back, you have to move your mouse everywhere until you hit them. Other than that, have fun. <p>
