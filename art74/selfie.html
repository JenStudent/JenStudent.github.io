<h1>These are some of the portraits that I have made of myself.</h1>

<p style="color:red;">So this is a portrait of me, which was created by using P5.js. It supposed to be me during the winter time, with the clothes and all that, as well as looking sick. <p>

<img src="https://jennystudent.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/6/7/136710700/screenshot-3_orig.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="weird me">
<p style="color:red;">This was the first draft of my portrait, which was supposed to be a bit abstract. It was a bit everywhere, I will tell you. But nonetheless, it was fun. <p>

<img src="https://jennystudent.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/6/7/136710700/screenshot-11_orig.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="food">
<p style="color:red;">This was made by using Processing, and I went with the simple approach to this and just place every bit of food in the space. I prefer to do it this way to make it looks simple yet delicious. <p>
