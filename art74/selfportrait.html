<h1>These are my self portrait that I made with P5.js.</h1>

<p style="color:red;">This is a self portrait of me, that was created by using P5.js. While it might looks simple and slightly strange-looking, I believe that I was able to capture that I wanted. I wanted to looks abstract, while maintaining my looks. So with a bit of moving around the shapes to certain area that I wanted it to be, I got it the way I visualized. It supposed to be me in my winter clothes, particularly when I was on vacation to Boston which was cold as heck. I also wanted to make myself looks slightly ill because I was on the trip due to the cold weather. Overall, I like it. <p>

<p style="color:red;">This is the draft for the self portrait. To be honest, I didn't try much and was more focusing on randomly testing out the equipment of the program. I was actually planning to make myself looks slightly more all over the place but I wanted you to know it was me, so I decided to tone it down a bit. But it was fun to see how it works. <p>
