<p style="color:red;">This first image was created in SPADE COCO, and was inspired by a cartoon series that was short-lived called Chowder. While it looks completely like nothing as the shows after running the model, I felt that I was able to captured the look of the characters ok as well as the kitchen. It could use some more work, but other than that I feel that I was able to draw my childhood a bit. The second image is the one I draw before running the model. I felt that the drawing represented the shows better when it comes to the color and position of the characters. I was able to captured the moment much better than after running the model. I think I was more focused on the drawing of the image rather than the outcome of it overall. But nonetheless, I think it looks cool.   <p>
