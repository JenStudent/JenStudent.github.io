<p>You found yourself standing on top of an strange yet familar building. You are unsure how you got there, or what exactly was going on. But you know something was off.</p>

<p> You then noticed that someone stood in front of you, standing over the edge of the rooftop. Their back was turned to you, so you couldn't make out any features.<p>
</body> Even though you can't properly see them, you feel like you know them from somewhere, somewhere from a long time ago. 

<p> There was no sounds or movement from the figure. They were just standing there, almost lifeless. <p>

<p> You try to talk to the person:<P>

<a href="file:///C:/Users/Miss.%20Jenny/Creative%20Cloud%20Files/two.html">"Who are you?" You asked, fearfully.</a>

</body> or

<a href="file:///C:/Users/Miss.%20Jenny/Creative%20Cloud%20Files/six.html">"You looks familar." You said, calmly.</a>
